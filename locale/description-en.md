# UCP2-Legacy: Patched AI Behaviour
The patched AI behaviour addresses the most blatant issues in the AI's ability to manage its economy, rectifying bugs.

Aside from these improvements, the AI is largely left in its vanilla state.
This replaces all the AI behaviours of the Vanilla AIs in their respective order.
